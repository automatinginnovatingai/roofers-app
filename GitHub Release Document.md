Ideal for users who need a reliable, cost‑effective foundation without advanced automation.

---

### Pro Plan
Expands on the Basic plan with enhanced productivity tools and deeper reporting.  
Designed for growing roofing companies that manage multiple projects and need more flexibility.  
Includes prepopulated database fields for roofing materials, employees, and client/jobsite data to speed up data entry.

---

### Enterprise Plan
Unlocks the full capabilities of the system, including everything in Pro plus advanced features and enterprise‑grade controls.  
Required for organizations with multiple administrators or complex operational needs.  
Serves as the base license for all administrative and employee‑level functionality.

Enterprise includes:
- Custom reporting templates  
- Priority support  
- Employee login functionality  
- Daily production input by field crews  
- Separate login pages for admins and employees

### Admin Add‑on
A supplemental license for each additional administrator beyond the main admin included with the Enterprise plan.  
Ensures secure, individual admin access without shared credentials.  
Cannot function alone — requires an active Basic, Pro, or Enterprise plan.

---

### Installer Add‑on
Available only to Enterprise customers.  
Provides employee‑level login access for organizations that deploy roofing crews or field technicians.  
Cannot be used as a standalone license.

---

## License Activation
This app requires a valid Gumroad license key to unlock full functionality.

- You will be prompted to enter your license key on first launch.  
- The app verifies your key securely via Gumroad’s API.  
- If the license is invalid or revoked, access will be restricted.  
- Internet access is required for initial license validation.

After activation, the app operates fully offline.

## Database
The Roofers App supports two database modes, selected during installation:

### SQL Express (Local Database — Recommended for 1–5 users)
- Automatically installed and configured by the installer  
- Ideal for individuals, small teams, and single‑machine setups  
- Fully offline and self‑contained  

### SQL Server (Remote or On‑Prem Server)
- Connect to an existing SQL Server instance  
- Supports multi‑user environments and IT‑managed deployments  
- Ideal for medium‑to‑large roofing companies with dedicated servers  

Both modes use the same unified application and feature set.

## Stability
This version is the current stable build distributed through the updater and serves as the foundation for all future updates.
